#### Brief Description of your Solution - 


In this business scenario, a customer has asked a software development firm to
create a social media platform where food and drink reviewers(foodies) may
discuss their dining experiences. Users should be able to post updates with one or
more images and a brief description, edit or delete their posts, view the profiles of
other users, follow other users, and be followed by other users. They should also
be able to like and comment on posts and get alerts when someone interacts with
their posts. The platform should be user-friendly and intuitive for non-technical
users and should be available as a client web application and a mobile application
(iOS/Android). The software development company is responsible for developing
the REST API and the client web application, while a separate company will develop
the mobile application. The entire platform must be secured with OAuth based
authentication and properly version controlled using Git on GitHub using the
GitHub Workflow.
